Our Crop Recommendation System is poised to integrating advanced technologies for an enhanced user experience. This system is designed to empower farmers and agricultural professionals by offering intelligent recommendations for crop selection, yield optimization, and profitability maximization by predictive training data based on NPK, Ph and humidity and many more input data fields through which the most profitable crop is estimated with additional data to justify and choose the suggested crop using a user-friendly interface. Streamlining data preprocessing, normalization with precision and reliability is our idea of integrating to assist farmers in this way.
The system will employ ML algorithms including decision trees, random forests, SVM, and gradient boosting techniques, to construct robust predictive models.
